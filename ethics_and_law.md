# Ethics and Law

Before doing any security research or data collection:
- Obtain explicit written consent from system owners and users.
- Work only in isolated lab environments or with explicit permission.
- Follow local laws â€” research that intercepts user input can be illegal without consent.
- Coordinate disclosure: if you find vulnerabilities, follow responsible disclosure guidelines.
